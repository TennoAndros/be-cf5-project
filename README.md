## üìã PROJECT SUMMARY

This project is a Node.js and Express application using a RESTful API and MVC architecture, written in JavaScript to serve data from a PostgreSQL (PSQL) database.

### 3. Seed local databases

In order to seed the local database with both the development and test databases you need to run a script.

Then to populate them with placeholder data run: `npm run seed` .

### 4. Run tests üß™

The script command to run the tests is: `npm t` .

## üóíÔ∏è Creating the environment variables

To connect in database locally you will need to create two files in your root directory:

- .env.development
- .env.test

Both of which will need to include PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>
Database name can be found in `./db/seeds/setup.sql` . You can amend the name of your database with something of your own choice.

**_THIS IS VITAL FOR CONNECTING THE TWO DATABASES LOCALLY._**
